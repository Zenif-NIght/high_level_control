**High Level Control**
This repo contains code for some simplistic high level controllers. There are currently three nodes in the repository:
1.  rand_goal_generator: Generates a random goal for each of the robots
2.  test_graph: Simple node to test out the progression through the topology graph
3.  topology_goal_generator: Has agents move throughout the environment according to a given graph where vertices of the graph represent locations and edges correspond to a topology over which the vehicles can move
